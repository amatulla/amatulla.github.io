		<h2>A little bit about me :)</h3>
		<p class="faded">
		I am extremely passionate about my education in cognitive science and neuroscience and aim to use what I have learned to have a deeper understanding of the mind and our cognitive capacities to optimize human functionality and enrich education research/teaching. I would like to pursue a career in which I can apply my programming knowledge in python, java, and C++  with optimizing our cognition and compliment, as well as enhance our cognitive capacities. I love watching sports and training in teams (cardio and weights) and enjoy partaking in track and field. I also love trying new foods and going to restaurants with my friends and family.

		Some of my interests: Watching hockey, cricket and soccer, making desserts, reading, swimming, travelling, biking, helping others, teaching
