		Hi everyone! My name is Amatulla; thank you for visiting my site. I just began making it not so long ago, so it's under construction :P. Thanks for your patience... :)

		<h2>A little bit about me :)</h3>
		<p>
		I am extremely passionate about my education in cognitive science and neuroscience and aim to use what I have learned to have a deeper understanding of the mind and our cognitive capacities to optimize human functionality and enrich education research/teaching. I would like to pursue a career in which I can apply my programming knowledge in python, java, and C++  with optimizing our cognition and compliment, as well as enhance our cognitive capacities. I love watching sports and training in teams (cardio and weights) and enjoy partaking in track and field. I also love trying new foods and going to restaurants with my friends and family.
