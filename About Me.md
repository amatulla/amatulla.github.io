# About Me 

I am extremely passionate about my education in cognitive science and neuroscience and aim to use what I have learned to have a deeper understanding of the mind and our cognitive capacities. With that I would like to optimize human functionality and enrich education research/teaching. I aim to pursue a career in which I can apply my love for tech and programming with optimizing our cognition and compliment, as well as enhance our cognitive capacities.
