# About Me 

I am extremely passionate about my education in cognitive science and neuroscience and aim to use what I have learned to have a deeper understanding of the mind and our cognitive capacities. With that I would like to optimize human functionality and enrich education research/teaching. Currently, I am pursuing education in Radiological Technology to integrate my love for human-interaction and providing care with my love for technology and healthcare.
