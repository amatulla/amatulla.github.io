# Amatulla Online Tutoring 

The pandemic has been a rough time for all of us, forcing us to stay in our homes. This has had the most impact on students and education. At school, we were often scolded for being on our phones (got detention or were sent to the principal's offcie), but when learning at home, school has been turned into a second priority and students are lacking motivation and mindset to learn. With the pandemic easing up and students returning back to school, it can be a struggle to learn new information while catching up on what has been missed the last couple years. Students need the right coach and mentor to bring them back on track to tackle the current information being taught in their classes.

I've been a tutor for over five years now, even tutoring during the years of the pandemic. I'm comfortable tutoring both in-person and have years of experience tutoring on an online platform too, to those students who have found it comfortable to be on their laptops studying. I have a passion for teaching math and sciences and allowing students to explore their "Aha!" moments while learning. If you or your child needs tutoring please feel free to contact me! I can tutor from Kindergarten to Grade 11 (all maths and sciences) at a very affordable rate (and online!). Thank you all!
